# AsteroidDestroyer
A simple javascript game inspired by Astroids

## About the project
This is a project that I made for school/fun. It was inspired by the old game where you have a ship that turns around and shoots
astroids that are coming at you. This is like a remake but adding more.

## How to run
Just open __index.html__ in any browser to play the game. Most modern browsers should work, but mostly tested in Google Chrome.

## Commiting
If you want to commit to the project, just send a pull request and I will look it over. Please keep it respectful. Don't submit
requests that just change formatting of the code.

## This is a work in progress
This game is a work in progress, and is still in an early, early alpha stage of development. Please keep that in mind when viewing
this project. It's not really even playable __yet__.
